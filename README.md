# SmartVisionForConvinceStoreOptimization
This project is web-based application named “SMART Vision for convince store optimization”. The main purpose of this web-based application is utilization of the space at the food stores to the fullest. As it known, that now a days each and every shop, offices, etc. require lot of space to accommodate large number of customers at a time. So, during selection of place for these centers, one should consider space as an important criterion. This web application works on mechanisms like Artificial Intelligence, Object detection. Cameras will be placed at concerned food store for space optimization. These cameras will record and detect the number of customers having lunch, dinner at the concerned food store. Using our smart algorithm, we’ll get the occupancy ratio of the food store during various durations of day. Thus, web application will be able to generate a monthly or yearly report of occupancy ratio at the food store which will suggest how to smartly utilize the unused space.
